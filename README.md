## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React: Built with React for a dynamic and interactive user interface.
  - Tailwind CSS: Utilized for responsive and modern styling, ensuring a sleek and intuitive design.
  - Chart.js: Integrated to visualize sales data with interactive charts and graphs.
  - Redux : Employed Redux for state management , facilitating the handling of sales data, invoices, and school details.


- **Backend**:
  - Node.js: Powered by Node.js for server-side logic and API development.

## Functionality

The dashboard currently implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing schools and invoices. This includes functionalities such as creating invoices, viewing school details, and retrieving school information.

The project can be further enhanced with more CRUD operations to make it fully functional.

While the project is not 100% functional, it demonstrates the core features of a sales management dashboard and showcases the ability to integrate frontend and backend technologies to build a scalable and efficient application.

## Project Scope

The implementation covers essential aspects of sales management, including invoice generation, school management, and sales data visualization. Further development and refinement of features would require a deeper understanding of the company's sales processes and system design.

I demonstrated proficiency in frontend and backend development, as well as the ability to design and implement a sales management dashboard from scratch.
